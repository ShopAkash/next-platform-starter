# Tailwind CSS Pro Tips

Tailwind CSS has become the go-to utility-first CSS framework. Here are some advanced tips to level up your Tailwind game.

## Custom Utilities

Create your own utility classes by extending Tailwind's configuration:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      spacing: {
        '72': '18rem',
        '84': '21rem',
        '96': '24rem',
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Pro tip: Use the `@apply` directive to create component classes from utilities!

## Responsive Design

Tailwind makes responsive design incredibly easy:

```html
<div class="w-full md:w-1/2 lg:w-1/3 xl:w-1/4">
  Responsive width
</div>
```

## Dark Mode

Enable dark mode with a simple configuration:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class',
  // ... rest of config
}
```

Then use dark mode variants:

```html
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 text-black dark:text-white">
  Dark mode content
</div>
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Purge unused CSS** - Tailwind automatically removes unused styles in production
2. **Use JIT mode** - Just-in-time compilation for faster builds
3. **Component extraction** - Extract repeated patterns into components
